Background You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.

Analysis Report: Analysis based on the Pymaceuticals data (a study on mouse tumor volume and drugs used)

The correlation between the mouse weight and the average observed tumor volume is positive (0.83). Correlation coefficent indicates there is a strong positive relationship between the two variables.

Out of 10 drugs 4 drugs named Capomulin, Ramicane, Ceftamin, Infubinol are used in the analysis. The median final tumor volume in mouse using the drugs Capomulin, Ramicane is low compared to the remaining drugs. This indicates that the tumor shrinks in mouse when mediated by Capomulin and Ramicane treatment. Capomulin and Ramicane are effective drugs in treating mouse tumors.

Line plot from the analysis shows the timepoint (days) and size of the tumor volume for Mouse ID l509 with Capomulin drug treatment. It can be inferred that the size of the tumor decreases with the intake of the Capomulin drug.

From the bar char we can observe that more number of mouses are treated with the drugs Capomulin and Ramicane.

Pie chart plotted for the Gender of Mouse and it shows Male mouse is 2% higher in count.
